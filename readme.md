###  Minimum Viable Product (MVP) User and Administrator Stories
- [x] As a user, I want to turn on a sensor.
- [x] As a user, I want to turn off a sensor.
- [x] As a user, I want to a sensor to quickly turn on and off (blinking/winking).

### Post MVP User and Administrator stories
- [ ] As a user, I want to turn on multiple sensors (new interface).
- [ ] As a user, I want to customize a sensor's action (on/off, blinking/sensor, etc.).
- [ ] As a user, I want to to know when a sensor is either working or not working.
- [ ] As a user, I want to record and store time and the LED light voltage's value into a database.
- [ ] As a user, I want to record and store time and the LED light color into a database.
- [ ] As a user, I want to select and visualize my sensor results within the application, using a linear chart (voltage vs. time, line graph, etc.).
- [ ] As a user, I want to sensor to alert about a certain event (Portland news, a special alert, earthquake warning, etc.).
- [ ] As a admin, I want CURD-L capabilities for ALL users.
- [ ] As a admin, I want users to have '--R--L' (out of CRUD-L) capabilities on other user's sensors.

### Instructions (assuming Mac OS)
* Clone repository and move to the home repository folder `j5-lec`.
* Install Xcode.
* Install Node.js https://nodejs.org/en/.
* Install node-gyp `$ npm install -g node-gyp`.
* Run: `$ npm install johnny-five`
* Verify the Arduino UNO is connected via USB to your computer.
* Run `$ node blink.js` to flash a RED LED every 750ms.
* Run `$ node led-rgb-blink.js` to flash a REG LED to blue every second.
* Run `$ node led-rainbow.js` to flash a REG LED to seven different color every second.

## Bugs
